This study predicts happiness levels using data from <a href="https://ess.sikt.no/en/?tab=overview" target="_blank">European Social Survey Round 11 (ESS11)</a>, working with 40,156 individuals across Europe. The problem was framed as a binary classification task. Four models‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost‚Äîwere applied, with **Random Forest** performing best (F1-score: **89%**, recall for the ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù class: **87%**).

- Feature encoding and selection
- Stratified train-test splitting (80/20)
- Scaling and handling class imbalance
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning via 5-fold Random Search
