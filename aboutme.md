Hi, I’m Ella Naderi, a former Industrial Engineer with a growing passion for data. I began my career in the oil and gas industry, managing engineering projects, coordinating installations, and generating performance reports with Primavera P6 and Excel.

Over time, I became increasingly interested in how data could enhance decision-making. This led me to shift my focus toward data analytics. In a retail environment, I analyzed customer behavior, built dashboards with Power BI, and developed automated ETL pipelines using SQL and Power Query — efforts that improved reporting efficiency and boosted campaign performance.

Eager to deepen my knowledge, I pursued a Master’s in Data Science and Society, combining my technical background with modern data science techniques. I’m now focused on transforming data into meaningful insights that drive impactful decisions.
