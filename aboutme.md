Hi, I’m Ella Naderi, a former Industrial Engineer with a growing passion for data. I began my career in the oil and gas industry, where I was involved in managing engineering projects, coordinating construction and installation activities, and generating performance reports using tools like Primavera P6 and Excel.

Over time, I became increasingly interested in how data could enhance decision-making. This led me to shift my focus toward data analytics. In a retail environment, I worked on analyzing customer behavior, building dashboards with Power BI, and developing automated ETL pipelines using SQL and Power Query — efforts that improved reporting efficiency and boosted campaign performance.

Eager to deepen my knowledge, I pursued a Master’s in Data Science and Society, combining my technical background with modern data science techniques. I’m now focused on turning data into meaningful insights that support impactful, data-driven decisions.
### My story

I started my new journey from my Master at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programs/fields/data-science)
