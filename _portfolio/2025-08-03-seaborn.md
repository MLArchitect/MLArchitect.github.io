This is my project description.


<p align='justify'>
Applying the <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> library in Python is a way of making attractive statistical visualization. 
There are some functions that help you to see regressions and predict the trends. I used data <a href="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/3996/datasets/e0b285b89bdbfbbe8d81123e64727ff150d544e0/mpg.csv">data</a> 
related to some famous brands in the car industry to analyze the relations between their features, including cylinder, horsepower, and 
weight. For instance, here, I plot weights and miles per gallon (mpg) data. Thanks to sns.regplot you can see the first and second-order 
regressions between these two parameters. It is evident as cars getting heavier, they consume more fuel. In other words, they travel less for a certain amount of fuel.
