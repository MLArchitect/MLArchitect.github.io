If you like to present your analysis through an interactive visualization in modern web browsers, there is a suitable library in Python 
(and other languages) called <a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh</a>. Here I tried to use data from the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/correlation-between-fertility-and-female-education">European Environmental Agency</a> 
to show varied relations between countries/regions indicators, such as life expectancy, fertility, and female literacy. For instance, following you can see 
how child mortality is less in countries with higher life expectancy in a specific year (1984).
